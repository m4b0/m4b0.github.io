➠ The Zen of Python
```
>>> import this

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

➠ Your loops create your thoughts. <br />
Your thoughts create your actions. <br />
Your actions create your life. <br />
Therefore, the quality of our loops determine the quality of our lives. <br />
```
Fix your loops,
Fix your life.
```
~ Mind Hacking

➠ Go Proverbs
```
Simple, Poetic, Pithy
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
Concurrency is not parallelism.
Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
Make the zero value useful.
interface{} says nothing.
Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
A little copying is better than a little dependency.
Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
Cgo is not Go.
With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
Clear is better than clever.
Reflection is never clear.
Errors are values.
Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
Documentation is for users.
Don't panic.
```

➠ The Twelve Factors
```
I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. Config
Store config in the environment
IV. Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources
V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding
VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model
IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams
XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

➠ Manifesto for Agile Software Development
```
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
```
