You don’t need an internet connection to have an easily searchable and extendable dictionary 
on your Fedora computer. You can use sdcv (StarDict under Console Version) and the public 
Stardict files on the default repositories to keep a local record for offline use.

sdcv is a command line variant of Stardict. Stardict is a part of a long legacy of GUI 
offline dictionaries. The “dic” files it uses are formatted as a colon delimited file, with 
the word in first column and the definition in the second column. You can have multiple 
lines with the same word and different definitions. sdcv will provide you with a search 
function and formatted display of your results.
