Keep track of certificate expirations to prevent problems with the ssl-on-demand script.

On the modern web, expired 
[certificates](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/what-certificate) can create major 
problems for websites, ranging from unhappy users who can't connect to a site to security 
threats from bad actors who take advantage of the failure to renew a certificate.

[Ssl-on-demand](https://github.com/abhiTamrakar/ssl-on-demand) is a set of SSL scripts to 
help site owners manage certificates. It is used for on-demand certificate generation and 
validation and it can create certificate signing requests 
([CSRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request)) and predict the 
expiration of existing certificates.
