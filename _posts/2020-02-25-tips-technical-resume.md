Present yourself in the best light to potential employers by following these essentials.

1. Summary statement

The short paragraph at the top of your resume should be clean and concise, have a clear 
purpose, and avoid excessive use of adjectives and adverbs.

2. Work experience

Numbers, numbers, numbers. Hard facts help you convey your point.

3. Search terms and jargon

With technology playing such a huge role in the hiring process, it is extremely important to 
make sure your resume gets flagged for the right positions—but do not oversell yourself on your 
resume. If you mention agile skills but do not know what kanban is, think twice. If you mention 
that you are skilled in Java but haven't used it in five years, beware. If there are languages 
and frameworks you are familiar with but not necessarily current in, create a different category 
or divide your experience into "proficient in" and "familiar with."

4. Education

Be sure that anything you have published or patented is included, even if it is not relevant to the job.

5. Certifications

Do not include expired certifications unless you are trying to re-enter a field you have left, 
such as if you were a people manager and are now looking to get back into hands-on programming. 
If you have certifications that are no longer relevant to the field, do not include them since 
it can be distracting and unappealing. Leverage your LinkedIn profile to add more color to your 
resume, as most people will read your resume and your LinkedIn profile before they interview you.

6. Spelling and grammar

Ask others to proofread your resume. So often, I have seen misspelled words in a resume or mistaken 
uses of words like their, they're, and there. These are avoidable and fixable errors that will create 
a negative impression. Ideally, your resume will be in active tense, but if that makes you uncomfortable, 
write it in past tense—the most important thing is to maintain a consistent tense throughout. Improper 
spelling and grammar will convey that you either do not really care about the job you are applying for 
or do not have the level of attention to detail necessary for the job.

7. Formatting

Ensuring your resume looks up-to-date and appealing is an easy way to make a good first impression.

**Update regularly**
Updating your resume regularly will minimize your stress if you're asked to (or want to) apply for a job, 
and it will help you create and maintain a more accurate version of yourself. When working on your resume, 
be forward-thinking and be sure to ask at least three other people to review it for content, spelling, and 
grammar. Even if you are recruited by or referred to a company, your interviewers may know you only by your 
resume, so ensure that it creates a positive first impression of you.
