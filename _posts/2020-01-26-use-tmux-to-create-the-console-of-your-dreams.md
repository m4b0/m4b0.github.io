You can do a lot with tmux, especially when you add tmuxinator to the mix.

Most people use tmux for very basic functions, such as opening it on a remote 
server then starting a process, maybe opening a second session to watch log 
files or debug information, then disconnecting and coming back later. But you

with tmuxinator, I don't have to worry about constantly resizing, placing, 
and launching my applications.
