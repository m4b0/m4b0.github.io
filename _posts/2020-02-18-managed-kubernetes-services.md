It’s not an uncommon problem for open-source projects — while vanilla Kubernetes is free for anyone 
to download and set up in their environment, it’s 
[too challenging](https://thenewstack.io/improving-developer-happiness-on-kubernetes-but-first-who-does-configuration/) 
to configure, update and generally manage for 
[most enterprises](https://thenewstack.io/qa-cncf-app-delivery-sig-chairs-talk-developer-experience-and-kubernetes/). 
Not only is the developer experience in Kubernetes less than ideal, but in most companies, there’s also a serious skills gap.

The good news is that, as Kubernetes adoption has grown, so have the number of enterprise distributions and 
managed Kubernetes providers who recognize that most companies need more advanced functionality and support 
than vanilla Kubernetes provides. A key part of all managed services’ selling points is better developer experience.

Managed service providers have to strike a balance between maintaining the flexibility that makes Kubernetes 
such a powerful tool while also being opinionated and prescriptive — removing the cognitive load of manually 
handling everything from configurations through day two operations.

Managed service providers are opinionated: They do the configuration work automatically, based on what 
they’ve determined to be the best practices. They all try to strike the right balance between making 
decisions for developers versus keeping as much flexibility as possible.
