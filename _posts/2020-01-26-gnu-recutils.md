There are hundreds of cool command line tools that have been made over the years 
built on the unix philosophy. Plain text is powerful, ubiquitous, and human-centric. 
It was also the only option for computing for quite a while. It’s no surprise that 
some of the most sophisticated tools are focused on it.

One such package is GNU Recutils, a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable, 
plain text databases called recfiles. Using plain text that is primarily human-readable 
as a database is just frankly cool as hell.

Recutils is a collection of tools, like recins, recdel, and recsel used to manage these 
recfiles/databases. They allow for all the normal basic relational database operations, 
typing, auto-incrementing, and even field-level crypto. All of this power is yours with 
the bonus that your database is a human-readable text file that you can grep/awk/sed 
freely, and a line-oriented structure makes it perfect for version control systems.

There’s other convenient tools, like the ability to convert to and from CSV formats, 
alternative output modes that make it work well with awk, password-protected fields, 
and so on. The package is quite robust and well maintained by Jose E. Marchesi, who 
can be found in the #recutils room on irc.freenode.net.
