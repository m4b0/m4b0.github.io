[Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/) was created by 
[Jesse Duffield](https://github.com/jesseduffield) to help make managing docker containers a bit easier. Simply 
put, Lazydocker is a terminal UI (written in Golang with the 
[gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) library) for the docker and docker-compose commands. Lazydocker 
allows you view projects, containers, images, volumes, as well as the logs, stats, configs, and top for your 
running containers.

Lazydocker also allows you to run bulk commands to stop, remove, and prune containers.

Lazydocker may not be for everyone, but for those looking for a solution that exists somewhere between the command 
line and a GUI, this tool can’t be beat. Give it a try and see if it doesn’t quickly become your go-to docker 
container manager.
