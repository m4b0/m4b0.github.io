Detection of compromises cannot occur without visibility into the activities 
going on with assets. Network security analysts can view these activities in 
one of two places, or sometime both--directly on the device and in the communications 
going to and from the device (i.e., on the network). The first step in threat detection 
is knowing which activities can be seen on a device and understanding how to instrument 
the device to provide that visibility.

Most organizations have a dauntingly large number of endpoints to manage and monitor, 
but you don't need to monitor them all. You may want to begin by monitoring your critical 
on-premise server infrastructure, then take what you learn from that to your cloud-based 
servers, all while working with your workstation support to develop strategies for 
instrumenting on-premise, cloud, and mobile end-user environments. Incremental gains will 
deliver incremental value and important lessons.

Feel free to take it slow; just make sure that you take it steady.
