When it comes to accessing and performing activities on remote servers using SSH, 
there are only few choices one can get. Most people use Putty and a graphical 
SFTP client like WinSCP or FileZilla to get their job done. Alternatively one can 
use web based control panel like Cockpit or Ajenti, which provides web based 
terminal and some graphical tools.

There are situations where command line is the only choice you have, and if you 
are not really a cli pro or simply do not want to go through all the hassle of 
using difficult command line options, you might face some difficulty.

Well there is one tool that might be of some help, and it was written 
specifically to provide simple graphical interface for most common tasks 
performed on servers.
