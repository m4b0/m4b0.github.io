Jeff Geerling presents 3 lessons he has learned writing Ansible playbooks.

The three main takeaways from his experience are:

1. Stay organized
2. Test early and often
3. Simplify, optimize

The importance of each lesson learned follows in that order, too; it's no use trying 
to optimize something (point 3) that's already poorly assembled (point 1). Each step builds 
on the one above.
