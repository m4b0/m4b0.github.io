GSConnect is an implementation of the KDE Connect project tailored for the GNOME desktop. 
KDE Connect makes it possible for your devices to communicate with each other. However, 
installing it on Fedora’s default GNOME desktop requires pulling in a large number of 
KDE dependencies.

GSConnect is a complete implementation of KDE Connect, but in the form of a GNOME 
shell extension. Once installed, GSConnect lets you do the following and a lot more:

- Receive phone notifications on your desktop and reply to messages
- Use your phone as a remote control for your desktop
- Share files and links between devices
- Check your phone’s battery level from the desktop
- Ring your phone to help find it

GSConnect makes it possible to enjoy a great degree of convenience and comfort. 
Dive into the preferences to see all that you can do and get creative with the 
commands function.
