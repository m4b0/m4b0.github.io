Get to know Rust's package manager and build tool.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern programming language that provides performance, 
reliability, and productivity. It has consistently been voted as the 
[most-loved language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) 
on StackOverflow surveys for a few years now.

In addition to being a great programming language, Rust also features a build system and package 
manager called [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Cargo handles a lot of tasks, like building 
code, downloading libraries or dependencies, and so on. The two are bundled together, so you get Cargo 
when you install Rust.

To expand your skills, try writing and running a slightly more complex program using Rust and Cargo. Something 
simple will do: for instance, try listing all files in the current directory (it can be done in nine lines of code), 
or try echoing input back out at yourself. Small practice applications help you get comfortable with the syntax and 
the process of writing and testing code.
