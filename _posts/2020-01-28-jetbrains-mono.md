A font to make working with code more comfortable for everyone.

For the most part of our day we, as developers, look at the code. And it is no 
wonder that we are always on the lookout for the best font to make looking at 
the text on the screen easier on our eyes. However, the logic in many popular 
fonts does not always take into account the difference between reading through 
code and reading a book. Our eyes move along code in a very different way, often 
having to move vertically as often as they do horizontally, which is opposed to 
reading a book where they slide along the text always in the same direction.

a new open-source typeface specifically made for developers.
