For the first time, environmental concerns are the top five global risks 
in the [World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report](https://www.weforum.org/global-risks/reports). 
The health of the ocean - or lack of it - is everywhere. 2019 was the hottest 
year ever recorded for the ocean, capping the hottest decade on record for the planet.

The ocean, which feeds us, regulates our climate and is one of the engines of 
the global economy, is changing at the fastest rate in human history. Viewing the 
climate emergency through this ocean risk lens paints a bleak picture, but it also 
points the way to practical, powerful solutions – because achieving a healthy, 
thriving, resilient ocean will have huge knock-on benefits for wider climate 
commitments, not to mention all the Sustainable Development Goals.

It’s a goal that everyone should invest in. Governments can be slow to act, 
but businesses, cities, communities and individuals can lead the charge. Young 
people have certainly made it clear that they won’t stand for it. It’s time for 
all of us to protect the most vulnerable from risk, heed the resounding alarm bells 
issued by scientists, and invest in a fairer, safer, healthier future on land and sea.
