if you’re paying attention you noticed that none of these keys overlap. That’s by default.

So you are able to manage multiple servers with a single connection per server, each connection 
having multiple shells through byobu (tmux), with each shell in turn capable of editing multiple 
files via Vim. And you switch between all these views from the keyboard only.

Most of the time what I like is to split the current view, in the left panel to edit sources, and 
in the right panel use some sort of watcher.

And that’s not really possible without Terminal, Byobu, and Vim.
