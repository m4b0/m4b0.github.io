Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is 
an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct 
ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs 
Research version of Unix.

At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands. The term macro processor 
means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, 
the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities.

Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input 
typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.

Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing functionality impossible 
or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot 
be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The history, 
getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they 
are more convenient to use as builtin commands.

Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather than to augment the programming 
language. These interactive features include job control, command line editing, command history and 
aliases.
