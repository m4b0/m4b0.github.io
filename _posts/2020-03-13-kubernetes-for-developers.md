Kubernetes was founded to help developers ship and scale their applications.

Containers package your application and everything it needs to run. This includes any application 
dependencies or files and the runtime environment for your application.

Containers, as the name suggests, are portable. You can spin up containers in different environments 
and different infrastructure.

Kubernetes is a tool used to orchestrate containers and manage them. Container platforms also help 
build, deploy, and manage your containers. 

The future of technology will involve easy to use tools and platforms built on top of Kubernetes 
for developers to develop and deploy code quickly. With this in mind, it’s useful to understand 
proper Kubernetes terminology and concepts, even if you’re not provisioning or deploying your 
applications as a developer. To learn more about container-native application development consider 
checking out [Twelve-Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/). If you are interested in learning more 
Kubernetes concepts check out [this post](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-an-overview/).
