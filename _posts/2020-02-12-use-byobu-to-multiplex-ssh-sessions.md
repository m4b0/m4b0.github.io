Byobu allows you to maintain multiple terminal windows, connect via SSH, disconnect, 
reconnect, and share access, all while keeping the session alive.

[Byobu](https://byobu.org/) is a text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. 
It's similar to 
[GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) but more modern and more intuitive. 
It also works on most Linux, BSD, and Mac distributions.

Byobu allows you to maintain multiple terminal windows, connect via SSH (secure shell), 
disconnect, reconnect, and even let other people access it, all while keeping the session alive.
