10 years of Opensource.com as a publication sharing free and open source stories.

"Each person who writes for us brings their own individual experiences and expertise 
to the table. When we launched the first version of the Correspondent program in 
2013—three years after our first article went live on January 25, 2010—we began with 
a handful of dedicated individuals. Over the past five years, that group has grown and 
become the heartbeat of our contributor community. They provide us with feedback on 
what’s going on in the world of open source, they reach out to leaders and members of 
open source communities and projects, and they pen articles that truly change lives," 
says Jason Hibbets, founding community manager for Opensource.com.

The Opensource.com community is open, kind, and inquisitive. And it's incredibly rewarding 
to be a member (and if you're reading this article, you already are).
