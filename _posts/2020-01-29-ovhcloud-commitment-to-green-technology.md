OVHcloud has focused on reducing energy consumption in data centers since 2003 
with the introduction of our proprietary water-cooling system. OVHcloud uses ongoing 
R&D to explore new and innovative approaches to reduce the consumption of electricity 
needed to run data centers. This is not only good for the environment, but results 
in lower cost of operating our data centers.  Customers benefit as these cost 
savings are shared.

Since 2010, new OVHcloud data centers have been free of the need for air conditioning.

The 30% air cooling + 70% water cooling = 0% air conditioning solution is deployed 
in new OVHcloud-built data centers.

OVHcloud designs data centers using an air flow management system that optimizes the 
use of outside air. The design allows fresh air to directly reach the front of the 
servers, which regulates the temperature of the fans and air inlets.

- Fresh air passes in front of the servers
- Air heated by the components is evacuated at the back of the servers
- Hot and cold air flow are separated
