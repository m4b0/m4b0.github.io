At first I thought programming just involved telling a computer what to do, this part of 
programming is relatively easy. After practicing for twenty odd years I reckoned that 
this part of programming was pretty easy.

**Definition1**: A program is something that transforms inputs to outputs,

A programmer is the person who writes the program, and programming is the act of writing this program.

Now let's add a few constraints to my definition of program.

**Definition2**: A program is something that transforms inputs to outputs, subject to the following constraints:

- The output of the program is beautiful.
- The input to the program is beautiful.
- The program is beautiful.
- The input to the program is well and correctly documented.
- The program itself is well and correctly documented.
- The program is well tested and proved correct.
- The problem being solved is well specified.
- The problem is well specified.

With these added constraints programming becomes extremely difficult.

Now for a particular problem some of these constraints can be relaxed.
