There are three types of books that are a must to grow your career in technology. Plus, 
three open source libraries to learn from.

So what makes all this reading worthwhile in an age where you can search and immediately find a site full of resources?

- Staying ahead of the technical and work-related curves
- Outside the box inspiration from fiction books
- Bulking up on burnout protection books

A set of open source digital libraries

Beyond your local library, there are fantastic libraries online that provide digital books for everyone to read:

- [ZLibrary](https://b-ok.cc/) offers up the largest digital library currently available, with a large list of categories.
- [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page), which has a more wiki design, has 66,000 books available to read and has a program for you to help set up an audiobook collection by helping read the books.
- [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) allows you to sponsor books as well as check them out for reading while attempting to archive everything they can for preservation.

Regardless of your motivation or categories of interest, use these resources to read whatever you need to keep learning and enriching your life.
