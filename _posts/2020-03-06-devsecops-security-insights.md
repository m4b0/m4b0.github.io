DevOps is a fast-moving space, but sometimes in the race to the finish, there are steps that can 
be overlooked — security could well be one such step.

[Snyk’s DevSecOps Insights 2020](https://snyk.io/wp-content/uploads/dso_2020.pdf?hsCtaTracking=b0e9bfa4-aeee-41f4-98f7-f05e605cfb31%7C154490e7-8f92-4d5a-9827-45d3d94843e8&utm_medium=Paid-Content&utm_campaign=Contributed-Article&utm_content=DevSecOps-Insights-2020-The-New-Stack-Q1-2020) 
report.

**Why DevSecOps Matters**

With DevOps, automation is a primary component of the process throughout the continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline. 
The concept of DevSecOps is about integrating security into DevOps.

So what should be done? We have a few ideas:

1. **Embrace security integration**. When teams are siloed with their activities and overall goals unaligned, they create tension and friction that manifests in security missteps.
2. **Security as a shared responsibility**. Having a sense of shared responsibility across the organization contributes to a security-first mindset.
3. **Executing well on DevOps is key to DevSecOps**. When organizations exhibit a strong level of DevOps tooling and culture adoption, they are well-positioned to further enable security practices and DevSecOps.

At the end of the day, it’s important that security isn’t an afterthought or something that’s bolted 
on at the end of the process. For security and DevSecOps to work, it needs to be an automated and integrated 
part of the process.
