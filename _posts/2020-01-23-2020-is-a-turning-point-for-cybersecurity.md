In 2020, the drive of the Fourth Industrial Revolution towards ubiquitous connectivity 
and digitalization will continue. But as new connections and technologies support 
socio-economic progress, cyberattacks and risks to and stemming from these innovations 
will increase in frequency and impact.

New technologies and new users will reshape cyber-risks in 2020. The emergence of 5G 
networks in 2020 will result in substantially broader access for both devices and people. 
Greater and more convenient broadband at higher speeds will encourage the development and 
deployment of everything from connected devices and ubiquitous computing to virtual and 
augmented reality and artificial intelligence.

In a hyperconnected world, however, no company can succeed alone and business leaders 
will need to find the right allies and partners in the private and public sectors 
to defend innovation and progress.

This year is likely to present a turning point, where new technologies scale and come 
online, exacerbating cyber-risk and affecting every business, government and individual. 
With these many evolving challenges, 2020 represents an opportunity for all public and 
private stakeholders to adopt better strategies and effectively collaborate at a global 
level through resources like the World Economic Forumâ€™s Platform for Shaping the Future 
of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust to build a more secure, more resilient and more 
trusted digital world.
