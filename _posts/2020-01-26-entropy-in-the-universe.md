First: what’s the ‘observable Universe’, exactly?

The further you look out into the Universe, the further you look back in time. You 
can’t see through the hot gas from 380,000 years after the Big Bang. That ‘wall of 
fire’ marks the limits of the observable Universe.

But as the Universe expands, the distant ancient stars and gas we see have moved 
even farther away, so they’re no longer observable. Thus, the so-called ‘observable 
Universe’ is really the ‘formerly observable Universe’. Its edge is 46.5 billion 
light years away now!

The entropy in all the photons in the Universe is even more! The Universe is full 
of radiation left over from the Big Bang. The photons in the observable Universe 
left over from the Big Bang have a total entropy of about 1090 bits. It’s called 
the ‘cosmic microwave background radiation’.

The entropy within the exponentially expanding ball of space that is today our 
‘observable Universe’ will continue to increase exponentially… but more to the 
point, the entropy density will approach that of a gas of photons and gravitons 
in thermal equilibrium at 10-30 kelvin.

Of course, it’s quite likely that some new physics will turn up, between now and 
then, that changes the story! I hope so: this would be a rather dull ending to 
the Universe.
