Given that a lot of stuff I've already covered in my original post, I'm not going to cover old 
ground again, so the prerequisites for this post are that you have a working OPNsense WireGuard 
implementation already, if you don't then read my previous post to find out how to get it up and running 
[here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/11/16/setting-up-wireguard-on-opnsense-android/).

I have no doubt in the course of time that default WireGuard support will be implemented into Gnome 
in due course, but this is a quick and easy workaround in the meantime, for those of you that prefer 
the KDE Plasma desktop, I've heard that it already has support, but I haven't confirmed this.
