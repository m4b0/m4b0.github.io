Try this script the next time you give a presentation to prevent making typos 
in front of a live audience.

The script mimics what appears as input/output and runs the real commands in the 
background, pausing at various points so you can narrate what is going on. The script 
and supporting materials are available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/lisa/lisa19-containers) under an Apache 2.0 license.
