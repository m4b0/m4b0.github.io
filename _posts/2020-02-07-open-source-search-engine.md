Search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo are demonstrably effective. You may have 
reached this site through a search engine. While there's a debate to be had about 
content falling through the cracks because a host chooses not to follow best practices 
for search engine optimization, the modern solution for managing the wealth of culture 
and knowledge and frivolity that is the internet is relentless indexing.

But maybe you prefer not to use Google or DuckDuckGo because of privacy concerns or 
because you're looking to contribute to an effort to make the internet more independent. 
If that appeals to you, then consider participating in 
[YaCy](https://yacy.net/), the peer-to-peer internet indexer and search engine.

There's much more you can do with the YaCy search engine than just search passively. You 
can force crawls of underrepresented websites, you can request the network crawl a site, 
you can choose to use YaCy for just on-premises searches, and much more. You have better 
control over what your internet looks like. The more senior users there are, the more 
sites indexed. The more sites indexed, the better the experience for all users. Join in!
