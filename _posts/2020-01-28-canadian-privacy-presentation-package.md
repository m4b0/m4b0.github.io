On January 28, Canada joins many countries around the world in marking Data 
Privacy Day with the goal of informing and empowering individuals and organizations 
to take action to better protect privacy and safeguard personal data.

This year, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) has published a 
[privacy presentation package](https://priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/your-privacy-rights/pp_101/) 
designed to open a discussion of the ongoing challenges to privacy. The presentation 
is for community groups, educators, parents, librarians and anyone else who wants 
to learn more.

Topics addressed include:

- Privacy rights and personal information
- Businessesâ€™ obligations to protect privacy
- Privacy settings and passwords
- Staying safe on social media and the web
- Avoiding identity theft and spam threats

Canada has observed Data Privacy Day on January 28 since 2008. The day commemorates 
the 1981 signing of the first legally binding international treaty on privacy and 
data protection.
