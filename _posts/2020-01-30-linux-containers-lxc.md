If you ask sysadmins why they love Linux, one of the early answers you’ll 
get is flexibility. It seems that Linux tools tend to be built with just 
the right amount of effort having been expended for you, leaving just the 
right amount of work for you to do on your own. Because a sysadmin is 
frequently getting asked to solve problems that don’t already have an 
obvious solution, Linux makes for the ideal building block.

The [lxc](https://linuxcontainers.org/) project is ideal for everyday 
container use. In fact, lxc itself was the foundation that Docker was 
built upon, and today there are plenty of platforms that leverage the 
work of lxc both directly and indirectly. Lxc, unlike other container 
solutions, doesn’t impose a specific daemon or toolchain. Lxc is so 
serious about fitting into your workflow that it provides Python3 
bindings so you can build tooling around it.

If you learn about lxc, you can integrate generic Linux containers 
into your own system design to solve whatever problem you think a 
container can solve.

Containers have changed the way development and hosting works. They’ve 
made Linux the default choice for the cloud. You don’t have to change 
the way you work to harness their power, though. With lxc, you can 
create and develop containers the way that they work for you.
