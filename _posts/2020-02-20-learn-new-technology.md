The "See one, do one, teach one" approach can help sysadmins master new tech with ease.

In medical training, they use the phrase "see one, do one, teach one." In technical learning, 
I think of it as "read, try, and apply."

When you propose your changes to other team members, that is teaching. When you document the 
changes for future administrators, that is teaching. If you really want to take the teaching 
step to the next level, set up a lunch and learn at your company, present your new skills at 
a local meetup, or write an article for 
[Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/join-community?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAAQ) or
