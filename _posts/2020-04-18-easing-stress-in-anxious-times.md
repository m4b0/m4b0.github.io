In times of heightened tension, like the kind many of us are living through today, what can we do to 
keep calm? 
[Psychologist Michael Gervais suggests we focus on the following essentials](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-manage-your-stress-when-the-sky-is-falling): 
our sleep, our eating, our connections to others, and our sense of purpose. Sleep and diet can aid 
our immune system and our emotional wellbeing. And though we may be physically distant from others, 
phone calls, video chats, and text messages can go a long way. The kind words we offer to others can 
also give us a sense of purpose amid uncertainty.

**How to Manage Your Stress When the Sky Is Falling**

Stress helps prepare us to meet the demands and challenges of our environment — up to a point. The chain 
of rapidly occurring neuro-chemical and neuro-electrical reactions can sharpen attention and our ability 
to assess our surroundings, motivate us, and even briefly boost our immune system. But it’s designed to 
be a short-term response to last for minutes or hours, not days and weeks.

**We may not have control over our circumstances, but we do have control over our minds**. Even if you think 
you’re relatively calm, know that stress is a stealth and powerful adversary. It can hit you out of 
nowhere. So we should all be employing mental skills and practices to get us through this trying time.

**Breathe**
1. **Take one really long deep breath — more than ten seconds — and try to exhale longer than you inhale**. Express 
one thought of gratitude.
2. **Set your intention for the day**. I don’t mean your goals or to-dos. I mean, what type of person are you going 
to be today? An intention represents a commitment to carrying out an action in the future. Are you going to 
show up for others? Be calm and controlled for family, friends, strangers, and colleagues? This is an exercise 
in imagery, seeing yourself at your best.
3. **Pull off the sheets and put your feet on the ground**. Take a moment to feel your feet on the floor. Be where 
your feet are. This is a primer to mentally and physically start your day in the present moment.

If you’re feeling unfocused or anxious during the day, take eight minutes and just breathe, observing your 
passing thoughts without judgment and bringing your attention back to your breath when those thoughts grab 
your attention. If you become distracted, re-focus back to your next breath. Try it. There’s no right or 
wrong way to practice.

**Eat and Sleep Well**

Try to wake up at the same time each morning, too — even if you had a bad night’s sleep. **Regularity will 
keep your circadian rhythms in check**.

**Eat and hydrate well, too**. In times of high-stress, our bodies crave sugar, starches, and salt. Eat 
colorfully. Dark and leafy vegetables (sorry, candies and chocolate don’t count) are an efficient way 
to feed the energy needs of your immune system.

**Create Connection**

Separation doesn’t have to mean isolation. Take this time to really connect with others. Tell them how 
valuable they are to you. Send messages of praise to your coworkers. Tell your family how much you love 
them. Make a list of people you want to call, to thank them for making a difference in your life. And 
don’t only broadcast your own concerns. **Be curious about how others are doing — and truly listen**. 
Do it today.

**Find Purpose**

So try anchoring this remarkable period in purpose larger than yourself. You get to decide 
the story you tell yourself. **When we have an orientation beyond ourselves, it makes us more 
resilient in the face of challenges**.

As you forge ahead, and things get tough, **remember that your most significant ally lies inside 
you: your mind. So take care if it** — for your own health and the health of others, too.
