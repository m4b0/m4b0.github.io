Address the real reasons you procrastinate and you’re more likely to start achieving your goals.

Experts like Tim Pychyl at Carleton University in Canada and his collaborator Fuschia Sirois at 
the University of Sheffield in the UK have proposed that procrastination is an issue with managing 
our emotions, not our time. The task we’re putting off is making us feel bad – perhaps it’s boring, 
too difficult or we’re worried about failing – and to make ourselves feel better in the moment, we 
start doing something else, like watching videos.

Research shows that once the first step is made towards a task, following through becomes easier.

The next time you’re tempted to procrastinate, “make your focus as simple as ‘What’s the next 
action – a simple next step – I would take on this task if I were to get started on it now?’”. 
Doing this, takes your mind off your feelings and onto easily achievable action. “Our research 
and lived experience show very clearly that once we get started, we’re typically able to keep going. 
Getting started is everything.”
