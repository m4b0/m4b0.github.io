S3 is an object store, not a file system. Object storage comes with significant advantages: unlimited 
storage capacity, high availability, and durability. However, there are some disadvantages too. For 
example, it is cumbersome to calculate the storage usage of a specific prefix (also known as a folder) in S3.

Luckily, there is a better way to analyze S3 storage usage.

- **S3 Inventory** provides CSV, ORC, or Parquet files listing all the objects stored within an S3 bucket on a daily or weekly basis.
- **Athena** queries CSV, ORC, or Parquet files and analyzes data on-the-fly.
