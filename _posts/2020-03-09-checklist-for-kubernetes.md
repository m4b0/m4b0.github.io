If you’re new to Kubernetes and have been tasked with researching a vendor-supported platform for your 
enterprise, chances are you’re feeling overwhelmed. You’ll encounter a seemingly never-ending list of 
vendors, all promising more or less the same.

To help you navigate the space and ask vendors the right questions, we created this no-BS Kubernetes 
checklist. All of the “must-haves” for a future-ready Kubernetes strategy are included in the list.

**Enterprise Kubernetes Must-Haves**

- Infrastructure Management
- Self-Healing Kubernetes
- Multi-Cluster Support and Centralized Management
- Multi-Environment Support
- Multisite Support for Reliability and Disaster Recovery
- Centralized Logging and Monitoring
- Security
- Full Automation of Day 2 Operations
- “Open” Open Source
- Configurability
- Command-line and API
- Intelligent Monitoring and Alerts
- Support for Multiple Kubernetes Versions
- Support for Kubernetes Upgrades and Updates
- 24/7 Support

**Nice-to-Haves**

- User-Friendly UI for Beginners
- Integrations with Kubernetes “Essentials”

Clearly, there are multiple aspects enterprises need to consider when migrating to a Kubernetes-based 
future-ready architecture. Unfortunately, not all enterprises fully understand their requirements when 
researching their options. That isn’t really surprising if you consider how new Kubernetes and cloud 
native is for most.
