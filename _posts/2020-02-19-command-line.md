DevOps job posts often ask for automation skills, which is a positive way of asking for someone who’s

A terminal is never just a terminal. An elaborate prompt can mean someone digs deeply into optimizing 
the tools she uses, while the information it contains can give you an idea of what kind of engineering 
she’s done. What you type into the command line can tell you about environment variables, hidden configs, 
and OS defaults you never knew about. You can make it speak shorthand only known to your terminal and 
you. And all of it can help you work more efficiently and effectively.
