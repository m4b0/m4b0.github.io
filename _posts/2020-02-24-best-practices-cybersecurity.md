Cisco's 2020 CISO Benchmark Study links a robust patch policy and collaboration to smaller data breaches.

Chief information security officers never seem to get a break, whether the new challenge 
comes from well-funded adversaries, increased business risk, new regulations, tight budgets, 
or talent shortages. Cisco's CISO Benchmark Study for 2020 offers some perspective on the 
dynamic nature of security work as well as some best practices to make life a little easier 
and data somewhat more secure.

* Collaboration helps cybersecurity
* Implement Zero Trust to tighten cybersecurity
 * Establish a clear identity and access management strategy that includes [multi-factor authentication](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/fbi-urges-businesses-to-use-biometric-factors-to-mitigate-multi-factor-authentication-risk/) (MFA)
 * Create an up-to-date asset inventory that distinguishes between managed and unmanaged devices  
 * Create a trusted device policy that prompts users to update their devices against measured vulnerabilities  
 * Control user access through a centrally managed policy that identifies and acts upon exceptions
 * Build an architecture and set of processes that enables users to access on-premise and cloud applications
* Test your response plan to prepare for cyberattack
** Review and improve security practices regularly, formally, and strategically over time
** Regularly review connection activity on the network to ensure that security measures are working as intended
** Integrate security into the organization's goals and business capabilities
** Routinely and systematically investigate security incidents
** Put tools in place to provide feedback about security practices
** Increase security controls on high-value assets as necessary
** Integrate security technologies 
** Keep threat detection and blocking capabilities up to date
** Make it easy to determine the scope of a compromise, contain it, and remediate 

The sixth annual survey included 2,800 IT decision-makers from 13 countries. The research team 
also spoke with a panel of CISOs to analyze the findings and build the list of 20 considerations 
for 2020.
