Depending upon how learned your security teams are, they might not deeply understand what you mean by 
[CI/CD](https://www.twistlock.com/2019/07/08/greatest-security-risks-lurking-ci-cd-pipeline/). Realize 
from the outset that many security practitioners do not have a software development background. This 
question is critical because it will allow you to spend time whiteboarding what your pipeline and 
processes look like. There are many positive outcomes that will surface from these sessions starting 
with security having a deeper understanding of how software flows in your organization.

choices and follow formal processes for putting them into practice.

*"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things." ~ 
Peter Drucker, management thought leader.*

When it comes to the cloud, you as the DevOps team have the control. There is however a corollary 
best known as the 
[Peter Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man) principle, in reference to the iconic 
fictional character whose alter ego is Spider-Man: *“With great power comes great responsibility.”* 
The question for DevOps then is what will you do with it?
