Retired FBI agent Chris Voss shares how crisis management techniques can help 
you negotiate a better salary. The article covers the following points:

- Focus on the relationship first
- Words matter (so ask carefully)
- Tips for the bare-knuckle phase of negotiating
- What if you don’t get the raise you want?

“Salary only pays your bills. It doesn’t build your career. If you focus on where 
the job is taking you professionally and the terms that go with it, you can 
potentially make your job much more valuable.”

Even if you’re prepared to leave your job if you can’t improve your salary or terms 
of employment, don’t lose sight of the relationship you have with your manager. 
(Regardless of when you move on, you’ll want to be able to list them as a reference.) 
It’s one of the most important relationships in your life. If you can embrace the 
difficulty of salary negotiations and navigate it gracefully, you’ll have strengthened 
that relationship. Which means you’ve won.
